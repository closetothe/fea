# FEA Implementation

This project was a simple (yet challenging) implementation of a 2D beam with a triangular finite element structure. It utilizes object-oriented features in Matlab, and fundamentally runs on a 'Node' and 'Element' structure. A Node is a point with coordinates and an Element is a group of three nodes. With this, it was easier to implement the mathematical model in an intuitive way.
